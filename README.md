## About the Project

<p>
Save an equation to run it later quickly. Add values as Constants or Variables, select operators, use parentheses to control computation order, and easily edit with a  drag-and-drop interface.

### Example Scenario

---
#### Example 1 - Simple Equation

An elementary example: Paycheck = Hours Worked * Hourly Wage. 
- Your Hourly Wage usually won't change, so we enter a value of 15 (for $15/hour)
- The Hours Worked will change week-to-week, so we'll assign this variable "HoursWorked."

`Paycheck = HoursWorked * 15`

Equation Saver will allow you to enter your hours, click a submit button, and give you an expected paycheck amount.

---
#### Example 2 - Complex Equation

Let's say, in the previous example, you wanted to account for taxes. We'll assume 30% will go to taxes.

  To figure 30% of the money earned in the pay period, we'll do: `(HoursWorked * 15 * 0.3)`. Then we take what we had before and subtract this 30%. `Paycheck = HoursWorked * 15 - (HoursWorked * 15 * 0.3)` For this equation, once you set it up, you only have to enter a value for the HoursWorked to calculate the next paycheck's amount. The simplicity of not having to enter this all into a calculator is what Equation Saver is intended for.
